Q: A new smartwatch is manufactured in one part of a factory, then secured for shipping in another, independent part of the factory. The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:
(A) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 7.0 grams (B) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 3.5 grams (C) Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams (D) Mean 394 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams
A: Let's think step by step. Since the weight of the watch and the weight of the packaging are independent random variables, the mean and variance of their sum is equal to the sum of their individual means and variances. So the mean is 62 + 456 = 518 grams, and the variances is 1.0^2 + 6.0^2 = 37, leading to a standard deviation of 6.1 grams. The answer is (C).

Q: After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?
(A) The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost. (B) The number of trees affected by the frost. (C) The number of trees sampled from the grove. (D) For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.
A: Let's think step by step. In this experiment, the response variable is what is measured. For each tree, what is measured is whether or not it suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost. The answer is (D).

Q: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12. What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?
(A) E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5 (B) E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13 (C) E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17 (D) There is insufficient information to answer this question.
A: Let's think step by step. While means of sums of random variables add (regardless of whether the variables are independent) in order to determine the variance of a sum of random variables, we need to know not just their individual variances but the covariance of the two variables, which is not given in this problem. The answer is (D).

Q: Which of the following sets has the smallest standard deviation? Which has the largest?
I: {1,2,3}
II: {-10,10}
III: {100}
(A) I, II (B) II, III (C) III, I (D) III, II
A: Let's think step by step. The variance of distribution I is the expected squared deviation from its mean (which is 2), so the variance is 2/3 . The variance of distribution II is 10^2 (because both elements are 10 away from the mean of zero). The variance of distribution III is 0, since it has a single entry. So distribution III has the smallest standard deviation and distribution II has the largest. The answer is (D).

Q: Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?
(A) If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1. (B) If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined. (C) Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation. (D) The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.
A: Let's think step by step. Statement A is false because the slope of the regression line being exactly 1 can occur even when the two variables are not perfectly correlated. Statement B is false because uncorrelated variables regression lines can have slope zero. Statement C is false because correlation is symmetric in the two random variables. The answer is (D).Q: What are the mean and standard deviation of a binomial experiment that occurs with probability of success 0.76 and is repeated 150 times?
(A) 114, 27.35 (B) 100.5, 5.23 (C) 114, 5.23 (D) The mean is 114, but there is not enough information given to determine the standard deviation.
A: Let's think step by step.

The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school european history.

Q: This question refers to the following information.
"The Italian nation has been at last united in our own days, and we all rejoiced in its union. Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. "Rome the capital of Italy" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the Å“cumenical position, the Å“cumenical traditions, of Rome&â€¦.
But the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department."
Edward A. Freeman, British historian and politician, The Chief Periods of European History, 1885
The author would likely take exception to the methods of which leader during this time period in Italy?

- (C) Sulphonylureas: Secondary treatment option, not typically first-line.
- (D) Insulin: Usually a subsequent choice, not the first line of treatment.
Reflecting on these options, Metformin stands out as the most appropriate first-line treatment, aligning with current medical guidelines. The answer is (B).

The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about virology.

Q: The median survival time to AIDS and death was established by following:
(A) Seroprevalent HIV-infected individuals (B) Seronegatives (C) Seroconverters (D) High-risk seronegatives
A: Let's think step by step and analyze each option:
- (A) Seroprevalent HIV-infected individuals: Already have HIV but not specifically relevant to median survival time.
- (B) Seronegatives: These individuals do not have HIV, not applicable for AIDS survival time.
- (C) Seroconverters: Relevant for tracking the progression to AIDS from the point of HIV conversion.
- (D) High-risk seronegatives: While at risk, they do not provide direct information about AIDS survival.
Reflecting on these options, seroconverters are most relevant for establishing the median survival time to AIDS, as they represent the group where the progression of the disease can be tracked from the point of HIV infection. The answer is (C).

The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about computer security.

Q: SHA-1 has a message digest of
(A) 160 bits (B) 512 bits (C) 628 bits (D) 820 bits
A: Let's think step by step and analyze each option:
- (A) 160 bits: SHA-1 is designed to produce a 160-bit hash value, making this option correct.
- (B) 512 bits: Incorrect as SHA-1 produces a smaller digest size.
- (C) 628 bits: Not a standard size for hash functions.
- (D) 820 bits: Also not a standard size for hash functions like SHA-1.
Reflecting on these options, it's evident that SHA-1 is known for its 160-bit hash value, aligning with option (A). The answer is (A).

The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional accounting.

Q: An auditor traces the serial numbers on equipment to a nonissuerâ€™s subledger. Which of the following management assertions is supported by this test?
(A) Valuation and allocation (B) Completeness (C) Rights and obligations (D) Presentation and disclosure
A: Let's think step by step and analyze each option:
- (A) Valuation and allocation: Concerns the value and allocation of assets, not their recording.
- (B) Completeness: Ensuring all assets are recorded, directly supported by tracing serial numbers.
- (C) Rights and obligations: About the entity's rights to the asset and related obligations, not recording completeness.
- (D) Presentation and disclosure: Involves financial statement presentation, not the recording process.
Reflecting on these options, the purpose of tracing serial numbers to a subledger supports the completeness assertion, as it ensures all assets are accounted for. The answer is (B).

The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about anatomy.

Q: Which of the following terms describes the body's ability to maintain its normal state?

## FAQ


### How to access the LLama2 model in Hugging Face?

1. Get approval from Meta.
2. Get approval from HF.
3. Create a read token from here : https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
4. `pip install transformers`.
5. execute `huggingface-cli login` and provide the read token.
6. Execute your code. It should work fine.


### How can I debug the model and print example prompt?

You can set `--limit 2` to only process the first 2 documents. Set `--write_out` will also print the example prompt.
For example, to debug the baseline experiment, run:
```bash
python lm_eval/__main__.py \
--model hf \
--model_args pretrained=meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,dtype=float16 \
--limit 2 \
--tasks mmlu \
--write_out \
--verbosity DEBUG 
# Add other flags here to debug different experiments
```
