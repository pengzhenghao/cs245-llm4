description: "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about astronomy.\n\
  \nQ: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\n(A) The Kuiper\
  \ belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like\
  \ the Kuiper belt. (B) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random\
  \ directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\
  \ (C) The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids\
  \ like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid\
  \ belt. (D) The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar\
  \ system just like the Oort cloud.\nA: Let's think step by step. Most short-period\
  \ comets come from the Kuiper belt, and we know because short period coments tend\
  \ to be in the plane of the solar system, just like the Kuiper belt is. The answer\
  \ is (A).\n\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about human\
  \ sexuality.\n\nQ: The most common disorder among men who seek sexual therapy is:\n\
  (A) premature ejaculation (B) inhibited ejaculation (C) erectile disorder (D) ejaculatory\
  \ disorder\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on human\
  \ sexuality for help. The most common type of arousal disorder for men is erectile\
  \ dysfunction, meaning that a person is not able to get any physical satisfaction\
  \ from sexual activity although he may be interested in it. The answer is (C).\n\
  \nThe following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about prehistory.\n\
  \nQ: What is the approximate mean cranial capacity of Homo erectus?\n(A) under 650\
  \ cc (B) about 800 cc (C) just under 1000 cc (D) 1200 cc\nA: Let's think step by\
  \ step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on prehistory for help. The average cranium\
  \ capacity of Homo erectus is less than 1000 cubic cm. The answer is (C).\n\nThe\
  \ following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about college computer\
  \ science.\n\nQ: Which of the following regular expressions is equivalent to (describes\
  \ the same set of strings as) (a* + b)*(c + d)?\n(A) a*(c + d)+ b(c + d)\n(B) a*(c\
  \ + d)* + b(c + d)*\n(C) a*(c + d)+ b*(c + d)\n(D) (a + b)*c +(a + b)*d\nA: Let's\
  \ think step by step. We know that:\n1. (X* + Y)* = (X + Y)*\n2. X(Y + Z)? = XY\
  \ + XZ\nUsing equation 1 we can rewrite (a* + b)*(c + d)? as:\n3. (a + b)*(c + d)?\n\
  Using equation 2 we can rewrite equation 3 as:\n(a + b)*c + (a + b)*d The answer\
  \ is (D).\n\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high\
  \ school physics.\n\nQ: A microwave oven is connected to an outlet, 120 V, and draws\
  \ a current of 2 amps. At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?\n\
  (A) 10 W (B) 30 W (C) 60 W (D) 240 W\nA: Let's think step by step. Rate of energy\
  \ usage is known as power; in an dissipative electrical circuit, power is given\
  \ by voltage times current. So in our case, the power is 120 V times 2 amps, or\
  \ 240 W. The answer is (D).\n\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with\
  \ answers) about college physics.\n\nQ: A refracting telescope consists of two converging\
  \ lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The\
  \ angular magnification of the telescope is\n(A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 20\nA: Let's\
  \ think step by step. In a refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging,\
  \ the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths\
  \ of the two lenses must add up to their separation. Since the focal length of one\
  \ lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification\
  \ is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. The answer is (A).\n\nThe following\
  \ are multiple choice questions (with answers) about econometrics.\n\nQ: Suppose\
  \ now that a researcher wishes to use information criteria to determine the optimal\
  \ lag length for a VAR. 500 observations are available for the bi-variate VAR, and\
  \ the values of the determinant of the variance-covariance matrix of residuals are\
  \ 0.0336, 0.0169, 0.0084, and 0.0062 for 1, 2, 3, and 4 lags respectively. What\
  \ is the optimal model order according to Akaike's information criterion?\n(A) 1\
  \ lag (B) 2 lags (C) 3 lags (D) 4 lags\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to\
  \ Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let\u2019s solve this problem step\
  \ by step. First of all, let\u2019s recall that for a given set of data, Akaike's\
  \ information criterion (AIC) allows us to measure how well a statistical model\
  \ fits the data; it is an estimator of prediction error. Here in this problem we\
  \ will need to use the formula ln(det(sigma_hat)) + (2 * k / T) to determine the\
  \ values of Akaike\u2019s criterion, where ln denotes the natural log function,\
  \ det the determinant function, k the total number of parameters in total (across\
  \ both equations), and T the number of observations (which, in this case, is equal\
  \ to 500). For 1 lag, the number of parameters in total is equal to 6; for 2 lags,\
  \ it is 10; for 3 lags, it is 14; and for 4 lags, it is 18. Now, let\u2019s calculate\
  \ the values of the criterion for each lag:\n(A) 1 lag: ln(0.0336) + (2 * 6 / 500)\
  \ = ln(0.0336) + (12 / 500) = -3.369\n(B) 2 lags: ln(0.0169) + (2 * 10 / 500) =\
  \ ln(0.0169) + (20 / 500) = -4.040\n(C) 3 lags: ln(0.0084) + (2 * 14 / 500) = ln(0.0084)\
  \ + (28 / 500) =-4.724\n(D) 4 lags: ln(0.0062) + (2 * 18 / 500) = ln(0.0062) + (36\
  \ / 500) =-5.011\nBecause the optimal model order according to AIC minimizes the\
  \ information criterion, the answer should be the one with the lowest value. In\
  \ this case, (D) has the lowest value. The answer is (C).\n\nThe following are multiple\
  \ choice questions (with answers) about medical genetics.\n\nQ: The stage of meiosis\
  \ in which chromosomes pair and cross over is:\n(A) prophase I (B) metaphase I (C)\
  \ prophase II (D) metaphase II\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia\
  \ articles on medical genetics for help. Prophase I is the stage of meiosis where\
  \ homologous chromosomes pair with each other and exchange genetic material. The\
  \ answer is (A).\n\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about\
  \ college chemistry.\n\nQ: 3 Cl\u2212(aq) + 4 CrO_4^2\u2212(aq) + 23 H+(aq) \u2192\
  \ 3 HClO2(aq) + 4 Cr3+(aq) + 10 H2O(l). In the reaction shown above, Cl\u2212(aq)\
  \ behaves as\n(A) an acid (B) a base (C) a catalyst (D) a reducing agent\nA: Let's\
  \ think step by step. A molecule that behaves as a base accepts an H+ ion (or proton)\
  \ from another molecule, whereas a molecule that behaves as an acid donates an H+\
  \ ion (or proton) to another molecule. Neither of these is the case for Cl in this\
  \ reaction, which rules out (A) and (B). A catalyst is a substance that only accelerates\
  \ a reaction without itself undergoing chemical change, which is not the case here.\
  \ This rules out (C). Instead, the $Cl^{-} molecules carry a negative charge, which\
  \ they donate in the reaction to form 3 HClO2. This is the behavior of a reducing\
  \ agent, or (D). The answer is (D).\n\nThe following are multiple choice questions\
  \ (with answers) about world religions.\n\nQ: How can the Upanishads be characterized?\n\
  (A) Ritual texts (B) Philosophical texts (C) Hymns (D) Origin stories\nA: Let's\
  \ think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on world religions for help.\
  \ The Upanishads are the most recent part of Vedas (the oldest scriptures in Hinduism)\
  \ and supplied the basis of later Hindu philosophy. So they are philosophical texts.\
  \ The answer is (B).\n\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with answers)\
