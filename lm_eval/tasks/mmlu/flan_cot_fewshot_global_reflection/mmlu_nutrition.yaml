description: "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about logical\
  \ fallacies, along with a reflective pause to consider our reasoning process.\n\n\
  Q: When an arguer causes confusion during refutation because of real or feigned\
  \ lack of an ability to engage in refutation, that arguer may have committed the\
  \ fallacy of\n(A) poor sportsmanship (B) appeal to compassion (C) argument against\
  \ the person (D) ignorance of refutation\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer\
  \ to Wikipedia articles on logical fallacies for help. Ignorance of refutation,\
  \ one of Aristotle's original list of logical fallacies in his Organon, is when\
  \ someone causes confusion in an argument through real or feigned inability to engage\
  \ in refutation, in order to win the argument. Reflecting on this, it seems crucial\
  \ to distinguish between genuine misunderstanding and strategic confusion in arguments.\
  \ The answer is (D).\n\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with answers)\
  \ about nutrition, with a moment for reflection.\n\nQ: What is the first-line drug\
  \ for patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity, as of 2020?\n(A) Acarbose (B) Metformin\
  \ (C) Sulphonylureas (D) Insulin\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia\
  \ articles on nutrition for help. Metformin (Fortamet, Glumetza, or others) is usually\
  \ the first medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes, as well as obesity. It works\
  \ by lowering glucose production in the liver and improving the body's sensitivity\
  \ to insulin. Reflecting on this, it's clear how crucial medication can be in managing\
  \ chronic conditions, and the importance of staying updated with medical guidelines.\
  \ The answer is (B).\n\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with answers)\
  \ about virology, with an opportunity to reflect on our learning process.\n\nQ:\
  \ The median survival time to AIDS and death was established by following:\n(A)\
  \ Seroprevalent HIV-infected individuals (B) Seronegatives (C) Seroconverters (D)\
  \ High-risk seronegatives\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles\
  \ on virology for help. The median survival time to AIDS and death was established\
  \ as a result of the development of seroconverters. Reflecting on this, we see how\
  \ epidemiological studies provide vital insights into disease progression and treatment\
  \ outcomes. The answer is (C).\n\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with\
  \ answers) about computer security, with a pause for reflection.\n\nQ: SHA-1 has\
  \ a message digest of\n(A) 160 bits (B) 512 bits (C) 628 bits (D) 820 bits\nA: Let's\
  \ think step by step. Since SHA-1 is a hash function which takes an input and produces\
  \ a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value, its message digest is 160 bits. Pausing to reflect,\
  \ we understand the relevance of hash functions in ensuring data integrity and security.\
  \ The answer is (A).\n\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with answers)\
  \ about professional accounting, including a moment for self-reflection.\n\nQ: An\
  \ auditor traces the serial numbers on equipment to a nonissuer\u2019s subledger.\
  \ Which of the following management assertions is supported by this test?\n(A) Valuation\
  \ and allocation (B) Completeness (C) Rights and obligations (D) Presentation and\
  \ disclosure\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on accounting\
  \ for help. The completeness assertion is tested by tracing supporting documents\
  \ to the record entries. Reflecting on this, it's evident how meticulous and detailed\
  \ accounting practices help in ensuring financial transparency and accountability.\
  \ The answer is (B).\n\nThe following are multiple choice questions (with answers)\
  \ about nutrition, with a moment for reflection.\n\n"
